        "\n",
        "In this exercise, you will extend the sound clustering task you did in E9 to a larger set of instrument classes and explore possible improvements to it. By doing this exercise, you will get hands on experience with Essentia and better insights into complexities arising in a real world Music Information Retrieval problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "In E9, you explored the tasks of clustering with sound excerpts of three instruments, three classes. As we increse the number of sounds and of classes, the average performance degrades. In such situations, clustering performance can be improved by better selecting the descriptors or by improving the actual computation of the descriptors.\n",
        "\n",
        "You need to install Essentia to compute some of the descriptors that you will be exploring for the task. You can find the download and install instructions for Essentia here: http://essentia.upf.edu/. Essentia has extensive documentation that will be useful in this assignment http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/index.html.\n",

        "If you do not want, or can, install Essentia, you can use a docker image to run a jupyter notebook server with Essentia included in it. You need to first install docker, https://www.docker.com/, and then run, in the Terminal, `docker-compose up` from the root directory of sms-tools which will use the file `docker-compose.yml` to call the image appropiately."

        "Improve the performance of the results of Part 2 by improving the descriptors used. Using Essentia, you should implement the following improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. More descriptors: Shortlist a set of descriptors based on the sound characteristics of the instruments such that they can differentiate between the instruments. The choice of the descriptors computed is up to you. We suggest you compute many different descriptors similar to the ones returned by Freesound API, and additional ones described in the class lectures. The descriptors you used in E9 (but now computed using Essentia) are a good starting point. You can use the Essentia extractors that compute many frame-wise low level descriptors together (http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/algorithms\\_overview.html#extractors)You can then use a subset of them for clustering for an improved clustering performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Computing the descriptors stripping the silences and noise at the beginning: For each sound, compute the energy of each frame of audio. You can then detect the low energy frames (silence) using a threshold on the energy of the frame. Since most of the single notes you will use are well recorded, the energy of silence regions is very low and a single threshold might work well for all the sounds. Plot the frame energy over time for a few sounds to determine a meaningful energy threshold. Subsequently, compute the mean descriptor value discarding these silent frames.\n",
        "\n",
        "Report the set of descriptors you computed and the performance it achieves, along with a brief explanation of your observations. You can also report the results for several combinations of features and finally report the best performance you achieved. Upload the code for computing the non-silent regions and for computing the descriptors that you used. Apart from the two enhancements suggested above, you are free to try further enhancements that improve clustering performance. In your report, describe these enhancements and the improvement they resulted in.\n"
