        "This exercise aims to get familiar with some basic audio operations using Python. There are four parts to it: 1) Reading an audio file, 2) Basic operations with audio, 3) Python array indexing, and 4) Downsampling audio - Changing the sampling rate.\n",

        "__sms-tools:__ . Sound analysis/synthesis tools for music applications written in python (with a bit of C). Available at https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools. They can be installed as a python package with `pip install sms-tools`. Materials associated with the tools are in https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools-materials.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Python:__ Python is a powerful and easy to learn programming language, which is used in a wide variety of application areas. More information in https://www.python.org/. We will use python in all the exercises and in this first one you will start learning about it by performing some basic operations with sound files.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Jupyter notebooks:__ Jupiter notebooks are interactive documents containing live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. More information in https://jupyter.org/. It supports Python and all the exercises here use it.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Wav file:__ The wav file format is a lossless format to store sounds on a hard drive. Each audio sample is stored as a 16 bit integer number (sometimes also as 24 bit integer or 32 bit float). In this course we will work with only one type of audio files. All the sound files we use in the assignments should be wav files that are mono (one channel), in which the samples are stored in 16 bits, and that use (most of the time) the sampling rate of 44100 Hz. Once read into python, the samples will be converted to floating point values with a range from -1 to 1, resulting in a one-dimensional array of floating point values."

        "When we downsampled the audio signals by a factor of 14, the output signals became significantly shorter in length and had a lower sampling rate. This process reduces the temporal resolution of the signals, which means fewer samples are used to represent the same duration of sound.\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparison to the Input Signals:\n",
        "The output signals lost some detail, especially in the high-frequency content.\n",
        "\n",
        "The audio sounds more distorted, especially for signals rich in high frequencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Visually, the downsampled waveform looks \"coarser\" or less smooth compared to the original.\n",
        "\n",
        "Difference Between the Two Cases:\n",
        "The vibraphone-C6.wav signal, being more harmonic and tonal, still sounds somewhat acceptable after downsampling, although it’s slightly muffled.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sawtooth-440.wav signal, which has sharp transitions and rich high-frequency content, suffered more noticeable aliasing and distortion after downsampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is because signals with more high-frequency components are more susceptible to aliasing, which happens when higher frequencies are misrepresented as lower frequencies due to insufficient sampling rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "How to Avoid Damaging the Signal When Downsampling:\n",
        "To avoid damaging the signal:\n",
        "\n",
        "We must apply a low-pass filter (called an anti-aliasing filter) before downsampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "This filter removes high-frequency content that cannot be accurately represented at the lower sampling rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The filter should have a cutoff frequency lower than half the new sampling rate (i.e., Nyquist rate)."
